# PadArq

This is just a small app that calculates some mexican specific parameter for architectural projects design used to apply for construction permissions.

I started this project as an excersice while I'm learning Python 3.5 programming language and I was looking to apply some my recentrly aquired knowledge.

This repository will host all versions as I continue improving my app, and this code should be treated as a practice and not a porfessional or final app.
